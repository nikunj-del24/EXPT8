Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements are used in Python to perform different actions based on different conditions. They allow a program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are true.

Python provides the following conditional statements:

1. if Statement

The if statement executes a block of code only if the given condition is true.

Syntax:

if condition:
    statement
2. if-else Statement

It executes one block if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

Syntax:

if condition:
    statement1
else:
    statement2
3. if-elif-else Statement

Used when multiple conditions need to be checked.

Syntax:

if condition1:
    statement1
elif condition2:
    statement2
else:
    statement3
4. Nested if Statement

An if statement inside another if statement.

Conditional statements are widely used in programs such as:

Checking whether a number is even or odd

Finding the largest of three numbers

Checking eligibility

Grading system

Menu-driven programs

Algorithm

1️ Algorithm to Print Numbers from 1 to 5

Start

Use a for loop from 1 to 5

Print the value of the loop variable in each iteration

Stop

2️ Algorithm to Print Even Numbers Between 1 to 10

Start

Use a for loop from 2 to 10

For each number, check if it is divisible by 2

If divisible, print the number

Repeat until loop ends

Stop

3️ Algorithm to Find Sum of First N Natural Numbers

Start

Initialize variable c = 0

Input value of n

Use a for loop from 1 to n

Add each number to c

After loop ends, print c

Stop

4️ Algorithm to Print a Matrix Using Nested Loop

Start

Declare a 3×3 matrix A

Use outer loop for rows (0 to 2)

Use inner loop for columns (0 to 2)

Print each element A[i][j]

Move to next line after each row

Stop

5️ Algorithm to Print Matrix Using Row Iteration

Start

Declare matrix A

Use for loop to iterate through each row

Print each row

Stop

6️ Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication

Start

Declare matrices A and B

Initialize result matrix with zeros

Use outer loop for rows of A

Use middle loop for columns of B

Use inner loop to multiply corresponding elements

Add multiplication result to result[i][j]

After computation, print result matrix

Stop

7️ Algorithm to Print All Different Permutations of Three Numbers

Start

Store three numbers in list d

Use three nested loops (i, j, k from 0 to 2)

Check if all three elements are different

If different, print them

Repeat until loops end

Stop

8️ Algorithm to Print Right-Angled Triangle Using *

Start

Use for loop from 0 to 4

Print "*" multiplied by loop value

Stop

9️ Algorithm to Print Pyramid Pattern Using $

Start

Set number of rows = 5

Use for loop from 1 to rows

Print spaces (rows − i)

Print $ symbol i times

Move to next line

Stop

10 Algorithm to Print Prime Numbers in a Range

Start

Use outer loop from 2 to 50

For each number, use inner loop from 2 to number-1

If number is divisible by any value, break loop

If not divisible by any number, print it (prime)

Repeat until range ends

Stop

If you want, I can also format this in practical record format (Aim, Theory, Algorithm, Conclusion) for submission.

Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements are used in Python to perform different actions based on different conditions. They allow a program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code only when specific conditions are true.

Python provides the following conditional statements:

1. if Statement

The if statement executes a block of code only if the given condition is true.

Syntax:

if condition:
    statement
2. if-else Statement

It executes one block if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

Syntax:

if condition:
    statement1
else:
    statement2
3. if-elif-else Statement

Used when multiple conditions need to be checked.

Syntax:

if condition1:
    statement1
elif condition2:
    statement2
else:
    statement3
4. Nested if Statement

An if statement inside another if statement.
